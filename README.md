# 📊 Tech Job Market Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes trends in the tech job market, focusing on:
- **Salary ranges** across various tech roles
- **Required skills & technologies** for different job positions
- **Prevalence of hybrid & remote jobs**
- **Salary and Location** analysis
- **Skills and Salary** analysis
- **Remote Jobs VS Onsite Jobs** analysis

## 📂 Files and their Purposes:
- **analysis_files** contains jupyter notebook and the analysis for popular jobs
- **joining_data** contains CSV files that were considered in the analysis file
- **separated_jobs** contains CSV files that were scraped from Glassdoor and separated on job_roles.
- **data_cleaning.ipynb** we cleaned the collected data(converted per month, per hour salary into per year, removed unwanted characters and so on)
- **data_extraction.ipynb** contains code for extracting data from Glassdoor website
- **separating_job_role.ipynb** contains code for separating the data according to job roles 

## 📂 Dataset
We will collect and analyze datasets related to tech jobs, sourced from:
- Online job portals (Glassdoor)
- Market reports & industry surveys

## 🚀 Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Scraping and gathering relevant job data
2. **Data Cleaning & Processing**: Handling missing values, standardizing job titles, etc.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends and patterns
4. **Insights & Reporting**: Summarizing findings with visualizations

## 📊 Visualizations & Insights
- Bar charts for salary distributions across different tech roles
- Word clouds for most in-demand skills
- Pie charts for Remote VS Onsite jobs
- Swarm Chart for salary vs skills

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Data Scraping** (BeautifulSoup, Selenium)
- **Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## 🎯 Goals
- Identify the best-paying tech jobs
- Determine the most in-demand skills
- Predict the future job landscape
- Provide data-driven career insights

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Expand dataset with real-time job postings
- Incorporate more AI-based trend analysis
- Develop an interactive dashboard
